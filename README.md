# Bellabeat : Smart Device Analysis Project

## 📝 Introduction 
The analysis will concentrate on consumer data regarding a company's marketing strategy and generate insights that back a company's strategy. Bellabeat is the story of a small-scale business that has excelled by producing advanced health-related products for women specifically. Based on the words of one of its co-founders, chief creative officer, and Urška Sršen, data from smart devices might uncover hidden trends within consumers. As we analyzed the users' data, we began detecting patterns in their sleep habit, inactivity, or level of activity. This analysis will outline such trends and provide strategic recommendations for marketing Bellabeat's products.

## 💬 Background
Working for a high-tech company that makes health-focused products for women, I am a junior data analyst working on Bellabeat's marketing analysis team. This is a successful small company, which could be the next major player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing fitness data from smart devices could uncover new growth opportunities. I will focus on one of the Bellabeat products to collect data from smart devices that understand how consumers use the product. The findings will serve as a basis for making recommendations on the direction that the company's marketing should take, which I will then present to the Bellabeat executive team.
