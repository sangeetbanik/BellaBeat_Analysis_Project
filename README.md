# Bellabeat : Smart Device Analysis Project

## üìù Introduction 
The analysis will concentrate on consumer data regarding a company's marketing strategy and generate insights that back a company's strategy. Bellabeat is the story of a small-scale business that has excelled by producing advanced health-related products for women specifically. Based on the words of one of its co-founders, chief creative officer, and Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en, data from smart devices might uncover hidden trends within consumers. As we analyzed the users' data, we began detecting patterns in their sleep habit, inactivity, or level of activity. This analysis will outline such trends and provide strategic recommendations for marketing Bellabeat's products.
